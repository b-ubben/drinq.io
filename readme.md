## What Does This Application Do?
This application allows you to find all of the happy hours within your zip code. For now, it is restricted to just California. However, it will expand as it moves on. This application will also function with crowd-sourced information. This means that you will be able to submit your own hours if the hours presented are erroneous. Why contribute? Because you'll get a shiny badge next to your name the more you contribute! This will appear next to all of your reviews and contributions!!
## But Why?
All of the other apps are inadequate. We are the final answer!
## Contributing
Of course you can contribute. Send a pull request over, and we'll take care of the rest!
## License
This application is under the MIT license.
